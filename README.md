Hey there! 👋 I'm Aydin Abbasi, a full-stack developer from Ardabil, Iran, who loves turning cool ideas into reality. I'm all about creating value for the community, not just chasing income.

I dive into the world of coding using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP, and I enjoy experimenting with tools like Neovim, Git, and Docker. Right now, I'm expanding my horizons by learning about networking and databases, and I'm on a fun journey to improve my English and Azerbaijani too! 🚀

Thanks for dropping by and sharing this adventure with me. Let's build something amazing together! 😊
