Hey! 👋

I’m Aydin (Some people call me Milad) Abbasi, a full-stack developer from Ardabil, Iran. I love turning creative ideas into real, working stuff. I’m not just here to make money — reating value and building things that actually matter is what drives me.

I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP. Right now, I’m diving deeper into networking, computer engineering, and databases, while also improving my English and Turkish along the way!

Thanks for stopping by and joining me on this journey. Let’s build something awesome together!
